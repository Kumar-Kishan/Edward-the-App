# NOVELIST LLC PRIVACY POLICY

The statement below outlines the Novelist LLC (“we”, “us”, and “our”) Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the products and services that we offer, however, the underlying goal of protecting user privacy remains the same. By using our service, each user consents to the collection, use or disclosure of their Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of our services, including Edward the App and associated features, following the "last-revised" date on this Privacy Policy will represent your consent to the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information under this Privacy Policy as modified. You are advised to review this page regularly for any changes.

If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, or feel that Novelist LLC has not complied with the Policy, they should first contact privacy@edwardtheapp.com.

## STORAGE AND USE OF USER INFORMATION

We store information as described below that could be used to identify users ("Personal Information") on our servers for the sole purpose of providing our service to users. We also store certain non-personally identifiable information using log files.

The following describes the Personal Information collected on our servers: email address, encrypted password, payment and usage records.

## COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE SITE

The email address of account holder is used for confirmation of a successful account creation.

## SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if the service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

## CUSTOMER SERVICE

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services. In regards to issues relating to their account, we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes.

## SURVEYS

Occasionally, we request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose information. The requested information typically includes marketing or product feedback information and, in some cases, optional contact and / or demographic information. If provided, contact information may be used for testimonials or to request additional feedback information. Users will be advised and given an opportunity to consent or opt-out of such uses. Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our website and service. Users' Personal Information is not shared with third parties unless we provide prior notice and the choice to users. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, the intermediary may not use users' Personal Information for any secondary purposes.

## ELIGIBILITY

We do not intentionally collect or use personal information about individuals under the age of 13. Consequently, use of this web and mobile internet site and all related services by children under the age of 13 is strictly prohibited. We reserve the right to delete, move, edit, refuse to post or take other appropriate action with respect to any messages, information or files which we, in our sole discretion, deem objectionable or otherwise in violation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

## COOKIES
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the users' computer or cellular phone tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies. We may also use cookies that are not linked to any Personal Information to store certain preferences about the user's use of the services. For example, cookies may be used to allow a user to set a preference to skip a verification screen when capturing information.

## AGGREGATE INFORMATION

We may use users' Personal Information to generate aggregated information that does not allow the user to be personally identified or contacted. Aggregated Information shows user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis and may be used to provide insight on the usage of our services.

## WEB AND MOBILE INTERNET SITE ACTIVITY

Like most standard Web and mobile internet sites, we store and use web server log files. These files include anonymous information about web browsers, such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Such log files are not linked to Personal Information through our service.

## SHARING

We will not share any information provided by users, except as follows:

### Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)

We may use users' Personal Information to generate aggregated information relating to activity on our products and services. This aggregate information does not allow the user to be personally identified or contacted and shows user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis. This information is shared with relevant Novelist LLC customers and partners.

### When We Disclose User Information

We may share users' Personal Information with our affiliates, subsidiaries and service providers for the sole purpose of providing our service to the user, provided that the information is required for and used only for such purpose and provided the information is used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We will otherwise only release Personal Information to third parties in the following limited circumstances: (i) if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally requires us to do so; (ii) if our rights or property or the rights or property of our affiliates, subsidiaries, service providers or the users of our web site or services are in jeopardy; or (iii) if the personal safety of users of our web site or services or other members of the public is in jeopardy.

### Business Transitions

In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' Personal Information will, in most instances, be one of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email prior to a change of ownership or control of their Personal Information. If, as a result of the business transition, the users' Personal Information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, users will be given a choice to decline such different use.

## LINKS

We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects Personal Information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by our web and internet mobile site.

## SECURITY

We employ security measures in order to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, theft and alteration of Personal Information under our control. However, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Consequently, Novelist LLC, its affiliates, subsidiaries, service providers and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents do not represent, warrant or guarantee that Personal Information will be protected against misuse, loss or alterations and do not accept any liability for Personal Information submitted to or collected by them nor for your or third parties' use or misuse of Personal Information.
