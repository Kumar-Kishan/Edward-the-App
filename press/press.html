      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>
        Edward is a writing app created by Isaac Lyman, a software engineer in Utah. Writing is his hobby; he has a B.A. in English and has been writing in multiple genres since the age of five. Edward was born out of a desire to bring novel writing out of the dark ages. Word processors and sticky notes are woefully inadequate for the challenges of long-form creative writing, yet they're what most authors use. Thanks to Isaac's experience in web technology and his love of novels, he was uniquely positioned to create a writing product that excels where traditional methods fall short.

      <p>
        The ultimate goal of Edward and of Novelist LLC are to use technology to lower the barrier to entry for aspiring writers. <a href="https://publishingperspectives.com/2011/05/200-million-americans-want-to-publish-books/">Nearly two-thirds of the population</a> wants to write a book, but the obstacles are too great for the vast majority of them &mdash; most don't even know how to begin. Edward is designed to fill this need. Every line of code is motivated by a belief that, with the help of the right technology, novel writing can be an accessible and productive hobby for millions more people.

      <h3>Product Details</h3>
      <p>
        The core experience is a side-by-side writing page, where users can look over their notes, outlines and research while writing each chapter of their novel. Chapters are organized in separate tabs within the app. The writing page also includes a mini-map (a bird's-eye view of the current chapter), which allows instant navigation to any paragraph in the chapter, searching by word or phrase, and constant visibility into progress made. The app tracks word count, paragraph count, page count and minute count for the current chapter and the entire novel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other features include visual analyses of the user's writing, instant search, and free or prompted writing exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limited</strong> user accounts are free for an unlimited time. They do not include online storage; for these accounts the user's data is stored insecurely in their own browser and can be lost if browsing data is cleared or storage quotas are exceeded. <strong>Premium</strong> accounts are $2.46 per month and include online storage of up to 20MB (about 10,000 pages) with automatic backups, as well as a few extra features in the app. <strong>Gold</strong> accounts are $10 per month and include 250MB of online storage (about 125,000 pages) and all Premium features.
