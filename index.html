          Word processors (like Microsoft Word) are good for formatting documents. But they're not good for writing.

          You end up staring at a blinking cursor and hoping your book will write itself. It's okay, we've all been there. The problem isn't your talent or training - the problem is that you've got the wrong tool for the job.

          Edward is different. He's an app for the writing process: planning, outline, development, and analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edward looks like this:

          On the left is a text editor, with a row of tabs above it so you can switch between chapters with a single click. Next to it is your chapter in miniature, with a built-in magnifier so you can scan your chapter on the fly. And on the right is your outline, containing anything you want to keep handy while you write.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edward is all about conquering the blank page, and he's very good at it.
