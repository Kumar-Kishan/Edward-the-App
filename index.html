          If you've ever tried to write a novel with a traditional word processor, you probably know the feeling of staring at a blank page and wishing your book would write itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's okay, we've all been there. The problem isn't you - the problem is that you've got the wrong tool for the job. Word processors aren't made for long-form creative writing.

          Edward is different. He's an app for the writing process: planning, outline, development, and analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edward looks like this:

          Front and center is a text editor, with a row of tabs above it so you can switch between chapters quickly. On the left is your chapter in miniature, with a built-in magnifier so you can scan your chapter on the fly. And on the right is your outline, containing anything you want to keep handy while you write.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edward is all about conquering the blank page, and he's very good at it.
