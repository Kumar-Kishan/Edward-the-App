            Sidebar is a writing app designed for authors. It encourages outlining, note-taking, rapid iteration, and big picture thinking.

        <h3>Why Sidebar?</h3>
        <p>
          Word processors (like Microsoft Word) are good at formatting documents. But the writing experience is something like this:
        </p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="./static/word-processor.png">
        <p>
          It's...blank. You're staring at a blinking cursor and hoping your book will write itself. It's okay, we've all been there. The problem isn't your talent or training - the problem is that <em>real authors don't write like this.</em>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="background-green">
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Sidebar is different. It's an app for the writing process: research, outline, development, and analysis. The only thing it doesn't do is advanced formatting - but that's what your word processor is for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sidebar looks like this:
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class="background-yellow">
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          On the left is a simple word processor, with a row of tabs above it so you can switch between chapters with a single click. Next to it is a zoomed-out view of your chapter (a "mini map"), with a built-in magnifier so you can scan your chapter on the fly. And on the right is your outline, containing notes, plans, citations, and anything else you want to keep handy while you write.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sidebar is all about conquering the blank page, and it's very good at it.
        </p>
        <p>Other features include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Instant word, paragraph, and minute count for the current chapter - just hover over the chapter tabs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fully interactive mini-map. Hover to see the magnifier, and click to jump to any paragraph.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instant search. Highlight a word or phrase to see every occurrence of it highlighted in the mini map. Click a highlight to jump to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            A permanent, fully restorable archive. Get chapters and outlines out of the way without deleting them forever.
          </li>
