            Sidebar is a writing app designed for authors. It supports (and encourages) outlining, note-taking,
            rapid iteration, and easy context-switching.

        <h3>Why Sidebar?</h3>
        <p>
          You've probably written documents in a word processor (like Microsoft Word). Word processors are great
          at helping you make your document look professional. But they look like this:
        </p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="./static/word-processor.png">
        <p>
          It's...blank. No place for your outline. No place for your research. No place for inspiration. If this
          is where you write, you'll spend a lot of time staring at a blinking cursor.
        </p>
      </div>

        <p>
          <em>Sidebar is different</em>. It's an app for the writing process: research, outline, development,
          and analysis. The only thing it doesn't do is advanced formatting - but that's what your word processor
          is for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sidebar looks like this:
        </p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="./static/sidebar-screenshot.png">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="background-yellow">
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Is that better or what? On the left is a simple word processor, with a row of tabs above it
          so you can switch between chapters with a single click. Next to it is a zoomed-out view of your chapter,
          with a built-in magnifier so you can scan and search your chapter instantly. And on the right is your outline,
          containing notes, plans, citations, and anything else you want to keep handy while you write.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way, Sidebar isn't just for books. It's great for essays, speeches, and scripts too.
